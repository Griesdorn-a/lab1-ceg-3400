# Lab 1 : CEG 3400 Intro to Cyber Security

## Name:

### Task 1

* How many unique users are in the data?
* How many salts did you create?
* How many possible combinations will I need to try to figure out the secret ID
  of all students (assume I know all potential secret IDs)
* Instead of salts, if you were to use a nonce (unique number for each hashed
  field) how many possible combinations would I need to try?

### Task 2

Make sure you put the nonce and word in the `coins` file as well!

* 3 different `000` point hashes with their respective nonce and word.
```

```

* a single `0000` point hash with respective nonce and word.
```

```
