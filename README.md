# Lab 1 : CEG 3400 Intro to Cyber Security

## Name:

### Task 1: Hashing

Answer the following in this file:

* Did you create `salted-data.csv` in the root of this repo?
* How many unique users are in the data?
* How many salts did you create?
* How many possible combinations will I need to try to figure out the secret ID
  of all students (assume I know all potential secret IDs)
* Instead of salts, if you were to use a nonce (unique number for each hashed
  field) how many possible combinations would I need to try?

### Task 2: Crypto Mining

Answer the following:

* Did you put any scripts/code used for "mining" in the `mining/` folder?
* Did you put the nonce and word in the `coins.txt` file as well?

Choose one of the following and paste your nonce+word(s) and hash(s)
* 3 different `000` point hashes with their respective nonce and word.
```

```

OR

* a single `0000` point hash with respective nonce and word.
```

```

### Task 3: Symmetric Encryption

* Desribe each image
* Are you able to infer anything about the original image?
* Why do you think this is?  Dig into the typed of each encryption algorithm and explain.
