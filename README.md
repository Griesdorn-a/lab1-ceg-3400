# Lab 1 : CEG 3400 Intro to Cyber Security

## Name:

### Task 1: Hashing

* How many unique users are in the data?
* How many salts did you create?
* How many possible combinations will I need to try to figure out the secret ID
  of all students (assume I know all potential secret IDs)
* Instead of salts, if you were to use a nonce (unique number for each hashed
  field) how many possible combinations would I need to try?

---

### Task 2: Crypto Mining

Make sure you put the nonce and word in the `coins` file as well!

Choose one of the following and paste your nonce+word(s) and hash(s)
* 3 different `000` point hashes with their respective nonce and word.
```

```

* a single `0000` point hash with respective nonce and word.
```

```

### Task 3: Symmetric Encryption

* Desribe each image
* Are you able to infer anything about the original image?
* Why do you think this is?  Dig into the typed of each encryption algorithm and explain.

### Task 4: Asymmetric Encryption
